🧠 Project Concept: Feedback-First Resume Builder

The Problem:
Most resume tools focus on formatting, not content. Job seekers—especially early-career professionals—often struggle to write strong, impact-driven bullet points. There's no real-time guidance to help them improve as they write.

The Idea:
What if a resume builder could coach you while you type?

This project is an experiment in building a feedback-first writing tool—one that:

Encourages users to use strong action verbs (“led,” “shipped,” “scaled”)
Prompts users to quantify impact wherever possible
Flags vague or overused phrases like “hard worker” or “team player”
Think Grammarly, but for your resume.

The Goal:
Make resume writing less painful and more effective, while subtly teaching users to think like recruiters and hiring managers.
